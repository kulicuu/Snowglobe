### Snowglobe App


Very quick and dirty prototype game/toy app of a snowglobe -- one of those little glass liquid filled dioramas with fake snow and elves and trees and whatnot.

####  Time spent:  

It's Monday morning.  I started on Friday, getting RN setup with GL, lots of false starts, this stage took all day.

On Saturday I reviewed boilerplate WebGL fundamentals, and got some rudimentary drawing happening.

On Sunday I got animation working and worked pretty late getting the core features working.
